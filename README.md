# Merchant Selection for Minimum Organic Activations

## Overview

This project aimed to identify the optimal merchants for each customer while minimizing organic activations. We employed various uplift modeling techniques, including s-learners, t-learners, and more, to assign a score to each customer-merchant pair. The goal was to maximize the probability of a transaction while minimizing organic activations.

## Project Goals

- Identify the most suitable merchants for individual customers.
- Minimize organic activations to improve cost-effectiveness.
- Utilize uplift modeling techniques to assign scores to customer-merchant pairs.

## Uplift Modeling Techniques

We employed several uplift modeling techniques to achieve our goals, including:

- **S-Learners**: S-learners are a class of uplift modeling algorithms that aim to estimate the treatment effect for individual samples.

- **T-Learners**: T-learners are another class of uplift modeling algorithms that estimate the treatment effect for each customer.

## Methodology

1. **Feature Engineering**: We created relevant features to characterize customer behavior and merchant performance.

2. **Uplift Score Calculation**: Using the chosen uplift modeling techniques, we calculated scores for each customer-merchant pair.

3. **Optimization**: We designed an optimization strategy to maximize the probability of a transaction while minimizing organic activations.

4. **Results Evaluation**: The results were evaluated for effectiveness in achieving the project's objectives.
